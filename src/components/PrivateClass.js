<h5>Personalised sessions are great for beginners and advanced practitioners alike. <br></br>
With one-on-one attention, you can work towards a specific goal and learn ways <br></br>
to build your practice based on your specific needs.</h5>

<h5>Book your private class with one of our teachers, online or in person, 
 private<br></br> classes for up to 6 people.
 Beginners will be introduced to the fundamentals <br></br> of yoga and Pilates 
 (postures, breath, philosophy) 
 and can ask questions, <br></br> break down postures and 
 receive explicit alignment instructions.<br></br></h5>

 <h5>For those wanting to advance your practice, 
 you will receive the teacherâ€™s undivided <br></br>attention as you explore postures, work through
 any obstacles and go deeper into <br></br>your practice than you might do in a public class.
